I am a software engineer with strong experience in designing and building architectural solutions, backend, and web. Currently, I hold a Solution Architect role at **Rently**, where I lead the development of scalable and innovative solutions that align with business objectives. My work involves setting architectural standards, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and driving technical excellence through best practices.

Before joining Rently, I held a Lead Software Engineer role at **H&M**. I played a crucial role in the Size Strategy and Optimization team in the scope of analyzing user needs and designing business-critical features to deliver high-quality software.

In earlier roles, I built and optimized backend services for complex geolocation systems at **Pointr**, and contributed to large-scale development infrastructure projects at **LC Waikiki**. My career foundation includes diverse experiences in e-commerce, enterprise solutions, and software infrastructure design.

Beyond my professional engagements, I actively contribute to the open-source community and have been a technical blogger since 2016. My graduation project was published as an academic paper in ASE 2018 (Automated Software Engineering). My passion for technology drives me to solve complex problems and deliver impactful solutions.
