I am a software engineer with strong experience in designing and building web, backend, and architectural solutions. Currently, I hold a Solution Architect role at **Rently**, where I lead the development of scalable and innovative solutions that align with business objectives. My work involves setting architectural standards, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and driving technical excellence through best practices.

Before joining Rently, I held a Lead Software Engineer role at **H&M**. I played a crucial role in analyzing user needs, designing business-critical features, and mentoring a cross-functional team to deliver high-quality software.

In earlier roles, I built and optimized backend services for complex geolocation systems at **Pointr**, and contributed to large-scale development infrastructure projects at **LC Waikiki**. My career foundation includes diverse experiences in e-commerce, enterprise solutions, and software infrastructure design.

Beyond my professional engagements, I am an active contributor to the open-source community, a technical blogger since 2016, and an academic writer in software engineering. My passion for technology drives me to solve complex problems and deliver impactful solutions.
